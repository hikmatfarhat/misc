This repository contains 3 somewhat useful programs that i use in some of my courses. Each of them is simple and small


1. Implementation of the CYK algorithm. Given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string it determines whether the string belongs to the grammar
   Implemented in C++. Files: main.cpp and utilities.cpp. The file cfg.txt is an example grammar
2. Tower of Hanoi with illustration using the pygame package. In Python
3. Suduku solver using the Z3 SAT solver. In Python
